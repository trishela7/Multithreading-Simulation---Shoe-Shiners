# Multithreading-Simulation---Shoe-Shiners



Multithreading Simulation (Shoe Shine  - Place) – Follow the logic below :

Shoe Shine Place consists of a waiting place with many chairs # ‘n’ and a shoe shiner guy with one chair.

                                        *** Please follow the logic  ***


1. If there are no customers to be served the shoe shiner(guy) goes to sleep.
2. If a customer enters the shoeshine establishment and all the shoeshine chairs are occupied then customer leaves place. 
3. If shoeshine guy is busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs waiting for their turn.
4. If a shoe shiner is asleep the customer that needs services wakes up shoe shiner.
