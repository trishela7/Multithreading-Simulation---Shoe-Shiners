# Multithreading-Simulation---Shoeshiners



Multithreading Simulation (Shoe Shine  - Place) – Follow the logic below :

Shoeshine Place consists of a waiting place with many chairs # ‘n’ and a shoe shiner guy with one chair.

                                        *** Please follow the logic below ***

1. If there are no customers to be served, the shoeshiner goes to sleep.
2. If a customer enters the shoeshine establishment and all the shoeshine chairs are occupied, then customer leaves place. 
3. If the shoeshiner is busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs waiting for their turn.
4. If a shoeshiner is asleep, the customer that needs services wakes up the shoeshiner.
